## Air Quality Prediction and AQI Development in a Polluted Italian City

**Introduction:**

Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health globally. This project tackles the air pollution challenge in a heavily polluted city in Italy by focusing on two key tasks:

**1. Predicting Carbon Monoxide (CO) Concentration:**

* We develop a robust model to predict the hourly average CO concentration using machine learning regression techniques based on environmental data and meteorological factors.
* This prediction allows for informed decision-making related to public health and air quality management.

**2. Defining an Air Quality Index (AQI):**

* We create a user-friendly AQI specifically tailored for the city, providing a clear and concise assessment of overall air quality based on multiple pollutants.
* This AQI empowers citizens to make informed decisions about their health and activities based on real-time air quality information.

**Data and Methodology:**

* We leverage a dataset containing hourly average concentrations of various air pollutants and meteorological factors within the city.
* For CO prediction, we employ feature engineering and advanced regression algorithms like XGBoost to achieve high accuracy.
* For AQI development, we analyze the relationships between individual pollutants and their combined impact on health, establishing a scoring system with clear air quality categories.

**Results and Impact:**

* The CO prediction model achieves high accuracy and generalizability, enabling reliable forecasting of air quality.
* The user-friendly AQI effectively communicates air quality to the public, promoting informed decision-making and potentially improving health outcomes.
* Our work contributes to improved air quality management strategies and public awareness campaigns, ultimately leading to a healthier living environment for the city's residents.

**Future Work:**

* We plan to integrate real-time data into the CO prediction model for continuous updates and improved air quality monitoring.
* We aim to refine and validate the AQI based on user feedback and expert evaluation, ensuring its effectiveness and ease of understanding.
* We envision developing user-friendly interfaces for visualizing CO predictions and the AQI, further empowering citizens to take action for cleaner air.

**Collaboration:**

We welcome collaboration with stakeholders like city authorities and environmental organizations to implement the CO prediction model and AQI for air quality management and public awareness campaigns.

**By contributing to cleaner air and improved public health, this project aims to leave a positive impact on the polluted Italian city and its residents.**
